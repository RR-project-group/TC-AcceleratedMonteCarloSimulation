# Final Project Details

## Porject Deadlines

- **June 13, 2025**: No further changes in the project repository allowed. 

## Our Project Presentation Date

- **May 26, 2025**

## Project Topics

1. Take a published (in a peer-reviewed journal, not Kaggle notebook) research paper with no code attached. 
2. Reproduce its (main) findings. 
3. Report on the problems along the way.

## Project Grading & Requirements

- **Final project (40 pts.)** + **Presentation (10 pts.)**

### Detailed Project Grading (40 pts.)

This is the breakdown of how points will be allocated based on what the course covers:

1. **Project stored in a repository from the start** (15 pts.)
   
   - Viewable history of well-described contributions from all team members who collaborate

2. **Code and results with appropriate documentation** (15 pts.)
   
   - Documentation (e.g. Markdown) appropriate for *full* reproducibility
   - Includes software versions, etc.
   - (Should be able to understand and run your project on another computer)

3. **Code in a clean and easily readable format** (10 pts.)

**Note:** 

- Use a repository dedicated solely to the project
- Collaborate with team members via pull requests or by making them collaborators
- Can use branches for development (do what's best for your workflow)
- Grading based on repository quality:
  - Well-kept with no junk files
  - Clear content organization
  - Proper and neat documentation (Readme.md)
  - Well-described results
  - Commit history shows continuous workflow and collaboration from all members (not a one-time file dump)

**Core Idea:**  
The project isn't aimed at testing your programming, econometric or statistical skills. The correctness of your analytic reasoning will not be graded. Instead, your projects should focus on:

1. The process of reproduction (did it succeed? challenges? what was missing in original? what didn't work? what could have been done differently?)
2. Making your own process reproducible
3. Documentation and good coding practices
4. Collaboration and version control via Git

## Presentation (10 pts.)

- Duration: ~20 minutes
- Must include all team members
- Should cover:
  - What the project is about
  - How it was done
  - How it works
  - Include short presentation of the code
- Projects will be run from a lab computer after pulling from GitHub repository
